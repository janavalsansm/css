CSS

1.CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
*External: External CSS consists of a separate file. The web page file (HTML) will link to this separate file.
*Internal: Internal CSS occurs at the beginning of an HTML file. This code will apply to only the file in which it is inserted. ...
*Inline: Inline CSS occurs inside the HTML file at the element level.


2.Syntax:
*CSS syntax refers to the way we write CSS code. In order to write CSS, you need to first identify the element in your HTML page that you want to style before adding styles using  of built-in CSS properties.


3.Selectors:
*CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
1. CSS element Selector:
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
2. CSS id Selector:
*The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
*The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
*To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
3.CSS class Selector:
*The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
*To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
4.CSS Universal Selector:
*The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
5.CSS Grouping Selector
*The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
*Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
